# Multimodal Neurosymbolic Knowledge Web for Ingredient Substitution

A system for personalized ingredient substitution using deep learning and contextual knowledge. Query via text, structure, or images with dietary constraints. Provides relevant substitutes with reasoning for informed dietary choices.

**Note:** This work is currently under review at AAAI. The demo and dataset will be made available upon acceptance and the conclusion of the review process.

## Features

- **Multimodal Queries**: Supports natural language, structured, and image-based queries.
- **Dietary Constraints**: Allows filtering based on 21 dietary labels (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, lactose-free).
- **Contextual Knowledge**: Integrates data from Edamam, ConceptNet, FlavorDB, and Wikidata.
- **Reasoning**: Provides explanations for the substitutions based on trusted sources.

## Data Sources

- **Edamam**: Nutrition and dietary labels.
- **ConceptNet**: Ingredient categories and alternative names.
- **FlavorDB**: Flavor compounds associated with ingredients.
- **Wikidata**: Information on origin, usage, and dietary restrictions.

## Code and Data
The code and data consists of proprietary information. It is currently under progress to construct a version that does not incorporate proprietary information. The code and open-sourced datasets will be released up on notification of paper acceptance.
